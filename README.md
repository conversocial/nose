Conversocial Nose Fork (sorry!)

This is only in place to fix a memory leak, as it looks like nose is dead.

At the time of writing version 1.3.8 has never been released to the world
via pypi.

I've filed an issue and PR against the main nose repository, if they are ever
merged then this can be removed and we switch back to upstream.
